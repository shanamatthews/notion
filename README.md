# Notion page creator

I like to use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to take notes on different things, including RWX Rob's delightful "Beginner Boost".
He keeps outlines from the lessons in a pretty structured format, so I thought it might be nice to create a little cli tool to create skeletons for my own notes from his outlines.

This project was mostly a chance for me to practice a bit of shell scripting. It also  uses the JavaScript [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/).


## Todo items
- [x] Create new page in Notion db with correc title
- [x] Add property values into newly created page including video link
- [x] Add page content (home page link, day title)
- [ ] Copy outlines from Rob's GitHub repo to page
- [ ] Get Materials attachment working
- [ ] Add proper emoji (waiting on Notion API support)
- [ ] Make this more generic (work with my Notion Zettlekasten DB)
- [ ] Clean up CLI interface (-h, add options properly)
